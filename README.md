# BeeSolver: The Un-bee-lievable Spelling Bee Companion

üêù "Buzzing through the NY Times Spelling Bee puzzles, one letter at a time!"

## About This Hive of Activity

Welcome to BeeSolver, where we turn the daunting New York Times Spelling Bee puzzles into a piece of honeycomb cake! This humble little repository is the brainchild of a mere mortal aided by the cosmic brainwaves of ChatGPT, which, let's face it, did about 99% of the heavy lifting. I was mostly here for moral support and occasional witty banter.

BeeSolver is not just a tool; it's a journey through the alphabetic wilderness, a lexical odyssey, a... well, you get the idea. It's pretty neat, and it tries its best, just like all of us.

## Features

- **Word List Wizardry:** Filters through a vast ocean of words, capturing only those precious enough to be 4 to 10 letters long.
- **Letter Juggling:** Generates maps and lists with such finesse that even a juggler would be jealous.
- **Puzzle Solver Extraordinaire:** Dives headfirst into letter combinations with the required letter and the optional ones to find that elusive perfect word.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone https://github.com/bryanhiestand/BeeSolver.git`
2. **Navigate to BeeSolver:** `cd BeeSolver`
3. **Compile the Code:** Assuming you have Go installed, just run `go build`. Or just `go run main.go`
4. **Run the Program:** `./beesolver` and follow the on-screen instructions to start your puzzle-solving adventure!

## Dependencies

- A brain (preferably functioning)
- Go Language: The whole thing's written in Go because, well, ChatGPT didn't complain when I wanted to overcomplicate this.
- Love for puzzles: Mandatory. No exceptions.

## Acknowledgements

- **ChatGPT:** For being the Einstein behind the operations and tolerating my "supervision".
- **Diet Coke:** For fueling late-night coding sessions.
- **Bees:** For the inspiration and for being awesome pollinators.

## Disclaimer

- This project is for fun. Or at least a couple of minutes of amused chuckling.
- If you find bugs, feel free to fix them. ChatGPT is brilliant but not infallible, and I'm... well, I didn't actually write any of this code!
- My attached word list is not the same one the NY Times uses. If you find a better one, let me know.
- Cheating is not cool.
- Please solve puzzles responsibly.
